	<hr color='RED'/>
	<p>
		IN recent study on neural network model, we have found out the mysteries lying in its high unlinear space separablility. Yes, it's called MANIFOLD transform.
	</p>
	<p>
		A Manifold is a curve or simply a topology that holds its inner-topological properties no matter how it is transformed with differentiable function, if we compare NN model to the SVM (Support Vector Machine) , then we will find it is much likely to be related to a kernel, say Guassian Kernel or X-square Kernel, they are a unlinear topology mapping method, the only difference is the kernel, ANN uses neural layers, and SVM applys kernel function. They are all doing the same thing: transform the input topology in low dimension to linearly-separable topology in high dimension. And SVM is a tight model, since it only employ transform space as large as it requires to represent a topology, which means it's dynamic in size. While ANN applying a fixed model with fixed size (mostly) to represent a topology, and it usually cost less time to adjust its topological shape to be well fit for input space.
